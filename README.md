Human vs. AI: Who's better at mental rotation? 
Human vs. AI Cognitive Efficiency: Mental Rotation in 2D
This project compares university students (N=10) against multiple generations of Google Gemini models (Gemini 3 Pro/Flash, Gemini 2.5, Robotics) on 2D mental rotation tasks. Test items were procedurally generated (Manim), administered to humans via jsPsych/cognition.run, and to AI models via the Gemini API using an identical prompt protocol.
Performance was evaluated with a custom Net Efficiency metric (Accuracy − Error Rate) / Time, and compared statistically using the Mann-Whitney U test.
Result: No statistically significant difference was found between human performance and Gemini 3 (p = 0.515) — suggesting near-parity on this task, despite humans retaining a higher peak performance ceiling. Older AI generations performed at or below random-guessing baseline.
